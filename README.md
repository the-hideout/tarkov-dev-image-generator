# tarkov-image-generator ⚙️

Originally written by kokarn, the tarkov image generator generates icons and grid-size images from the tarkov icon cache folder. This fork was made after kokarn made the decision to shutdown Tarkov Tools.

## Usage 🔨

To use this utility, you need to have `node` installed. You can then do the following steps:

1. Clone this repo
2. Install dependencies - `npm install`
3. Run the script - `npm start`

The results will be placed in two folders:

- `generated-images/`
- `generated-images-missing/`

The results will contain `base-image`, `grid-image`, and `icon` files
